<h1>Show Fortran Results</h1>

<p>This page will display the results of running the fortran code. We probably want to have this first try to compile
the fortran code, and if that succeeds, it tries to run the code instead.</p>

<p>The code that you submitted was <br>
    {{code}}</p>

<p> The compilation errors were <br>{{errors}}</p>

<p> The results are <br>
    {{results}}
